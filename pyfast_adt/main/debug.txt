######### test temscript 28032023 #########
temscript work on DM only in STA mode, not in MTA
so in the comtypes or _com change the call of CoinitializeEX with:

line 373 _com, in temscript, before: 

_ole32 = ctypes.oledll.ole32
_ole32.CoInitializeEx(None, ctypes.c_int(COINIT_MULTITHREADED))
_oleauto = ctypes.windll.oleaut32

line 372 _com, in temscript after:

_ole32 = ctypes.oledll.ole32
try:
    _ole32.CoInitializeEx(None, ctypes.c_int(COINIT_MULTITHREADED))
except:
    print('MTA failed switch to STA')
    COINIT_MULTITHREADED = 2
    _ole32.CoInitializeEx(None, ctypes.c_int(COINIT_MULTITHREADED))
_oleauto = ctypes.windll.oleaut32

######### added a try to switch model ###########

test tkinter 28032023

to start root = Tk(), you should add baseName = str(...) otherwise crash due to sys.argv[0] in the __init__ of tkinter
i.e. root = Tk(baseName = 'hello') 

ofc the dm gui of the script is blocked up to the script is resolved but you can continue to use DM to due stuff in the mean time

############# import packages and modules 

this python environment don't have access to sys variables, so you need to append them specifically in order to let it search a package from outside python
ofc will be better to put a check if in sys the path is already appended or not
i.e.
import sys
sys.path.append(str(path that you need))
from temscript_remote_test import beamshift_test 

#############
using temscript and stage movement i found that, the spirit have a beam shift 2d reference rotated of 212 degree 
wrt to the system of temscript and the stage is -90 degree rotated
so applying a matrix rotation now we can move beam shift and stage as the panels.
######################
during the wobbler the stage is busy and we cannot move z using the scripting interface
